1. PROJECT TODO
    1. Write implementations of libitcclient functions
        - understanding v8 engine
        - bind javascript code to libircclient functions call
    2. Compile binary module binding.node
    3. Write testing javascript
    4. Write simple web-face for irc-chatting
-----------------------------------------------
2. COMMIT HISTORY
    10.03.11:   First commit: README, package.json files, TODO list
    17.03.11:   Added accessors for channel connection processing
    12.04.11:   Testing environment for libircclient and libev - testirc
    19.04.11:   Working tests: sending and recieving messages via console works well. Handling connected/recieved message events. New design of main module file (binding.cc)
    20.04.11:   CreateSession function prototype done. Arguments now are two callback functions
    20.04.11:   Persistent callback functions done. Now we can describe callbacks directly from javascript
    25.04.11:   Functions SendMsg, Join done, now everything can be done directly from JS
    27.04.11:   All about IRC events now works in another thread. ConnectCallback is working. Everything works in parallel with nodejs event loop. Web server and irc connection in example test.js
    28.04.11:   RecievedCallback events. Testing Web-page on 127.0.0.1:8100 - wait for connection to be viewed from console. Everything works fine, but we need a new arquitect to hold many irc connections. For showtime - small javascript which populates the page with new irc messages.
    03.05.11:   Testing web-page with chat window. Fixed some errors with memory management.
    11.05.11:   Many fixes, function Run() now works fine and is non-blocking. Time to begin with lots of sessions.
    16.05.11:   All callbacks for irc.SessionCreate(x) now are in a JavaScript object x.
    17.05.11:   Works with multiple sessions!
    17.05.11:   Two users in test.js: one for web-ui and one just bot.
    25.05.11:   Fixed bugs on 64-bit systems, state UML diagram.
    25.05.11:   Sequence UML diagram; header file binding.h with all necesarry information about JS functions.
